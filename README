ADAM
=====================================

This directory contains the source code distribution of dbADAM. 

dbADAM is based on PostgreSQL and supports nearest neigbour retrieval for feature vector data. In addition, it comes with Vector Approximation-File to make querying more efficient.

ADAM is being developed in the course of the iMotion project (http://imotion-project.eu) at the Databases and Information Systems Research Group (http://dbis.cs.unibas.ch) at the University of Basel, Switzerland. ADAM is no longer in development; the successor ADAMpro can be found at https://github.com/vitrivr/ADAMpro/
